## Clustered Index
Cluster index is a type of index which sorts the data rows in the table on their key values. 
In the Database, there is only one clustered index per table.

A clustered index defines the order in which data is stored in the table which can be sorted in only one way. 
So, there can be an only a single clustered index for every table. 
In an RDBMS, usually, the primary key allows you to create a clustered index based on that specific column.

## Non-Clustered Index

A Non-clustered index stores the data at one location and indices at another location. 
The index contains pointers to the location of that data. 
A single table can have many non-clustered indexes as an index in the non-clustered index is stored in different places.

A non-clustering index is defined in the non-ordering field of the table. 
This type of indexing method helps you to improve the performance of queries that use keys which are not assigned as a primary key. 
A non-clustered index allows you to add a unique key for a table.

KEY DIFFERENCE
- Cluster index is a type of index that sorts the data rows in the table on their key values whereas the Non-clustered index stores the data at one location and indices at another location.
Clustered index stores data pages in the leaf nodes of the index while Non-clustered index method never stores data pages in the leaf nodes of the index.
Cluster index doesn’t require additional disk space whereas the Non-clustered index requires additional disk space.
Cluster index offers faster data accessing, on the other hand, Non-clustered index is slower.
