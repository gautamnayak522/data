        <div class="ex1"> Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by
            Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system.
            o Git is an example of DVCS (Distributed version control system), hence every developer's
            working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all
            changes.
            o The row performance characteristics of Git are very strong when compared to many
            alternatives.
            o Having a full local history makes Git fast, since it means you dont need a network
            connection to create commits, inspect previous versions of a file, or perform diffs
            between commits.
