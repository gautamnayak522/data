    <p class="my-5 mx-56 text-justify text-lg">Ahmedabad or Amdavad as Gujaratis love to call it, is a city that paints a pretty picture of fun, frolic, colours of the chaniya cholis and the taste of gathiyas and undhiyu. It is the first in the world to be declared a World Heritage City by UNESCO. Ahmedabad has undergone continuous change since the time it was conceptualised and founded by Sultan Ahmed Shah. But, all through these years, something that has stayed constant is the love of the city for celebrating life, and preserving its heritage through its architectural wonders. These wonders are now the pride of the city and are some of the top tourist attractions of Gujarat. Apart from these, there are several parks and water tanks in the city that are worthy of a visit.</p>
